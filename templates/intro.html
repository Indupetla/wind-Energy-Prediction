                    Renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, plays an increasing role in the
                    supply of energy worldwide. This trend will continue because global energy demand is
                    increasing, and the use of nuclear power and traditional sources of energy such as coal
                    and oil is unsafe and leads to a large amount of CO₂ emission. Wind energy is a key
                    player in the field of renewable energy. In Europe, the capacity of wind energy
                    production has doubled from 2009 to 2010.

                    However, levels of production of wind energy are hard to predict as they rely on
                    potentially unstable weather conditions present at the wind farm. In particular, wind
                    speed is crucial for energy production based on wind, and it may vary drastically over
                    time. Energy suppliers are interested in accurate predictions, as they can avoid
                    overproduction by coordinating the collaborative production of traditional power
                    plants and weather-dependent energy sources. The energy can be predicted based on
                    the power curve and the windspeed.
